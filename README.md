LSTM Stock Price Predictor

Predict stock prices using historical data with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in Python. Users can input any stock ticker symbol and receive predicted future prices, visualized against actual historical data. The project uses PyTorch for modeling, yfinance for dynamic data fetching, and scikit-learn for preprocessing, demonstrating skills in time series forecasting, deep learning, and Python programming in a Jupyter Notebook workflow.

Features: Fetch historical stock data dynamically for any ticker, preprocess with scaling and sequence generation, train an LSTM model for next-day price prediction, visualize predictions vs actual prices, and interactively input tickers.

Tools: Python, PyTorch, yfinance, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Setup & Usage: Clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/Shen40/lstm-stock-predictor.git), optionally create and activate a virtual environment, install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt), then open stock_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter, run the notebook, and input a stock ticker symbol to see predictions.

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open stock_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter, run the notebook, and input a stock ticker symbol to see predictions.
